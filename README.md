# The-Effect-of-Alcohol-in-Life-Expectancy

The relationship between alcohol consumption and life expectancy remains a contentious issue in scientific discourse. While some studies suggest that moderate alcohol intake may offer health benefits and potentially increase longevity, others warn of its adverse effects on overall health and mortality rates. This project explores the association between alcohol consumption and life expectancy using observational data from 193 nations spanning 2000 to 2005. By leveraging statistical modeling techniques, particularly linear regression, we aim to elucidate the complex interplay between these variables.
